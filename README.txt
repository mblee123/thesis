Overall, if you need to learn how to run it, see the main method in trap.py,
it gives some sample runs.
You need to initialized an origin for your coordinate system, and to give the particle
an initial velocity and position.
Then create an environment which describes the lab environment, a particle which describes your trapping particle
and a beam which describes the trapping beam, then run for a set time, and set number of timesteps.
The trace.py method contains most of the important things, with the exception of the interpollation
which is in trap.py.
This should all be commented and documented in my thesis, but if you need help, reach me at the above email, or my
Mudd email, albeit I don't expect to check the later frequently.
Best of luck.
